                Hello Everyone! Im Jian and to date, I am still currently studying in University of St. La Salle taking up the course
                Bachelor of Science and Technology. Despite this difficult online set up, I managed to learn something new everyday in this class.
                A few example of this is learning how to apply CSS,PHP and HTML to make an awesome Website! and after pulling of a few all nighters and 
                a hell lot of coffee, I managed to make this portfolio that showcases my different works in the Subject "Introduction to Web Authoring"
                This portfolio will be my stepping stone in achieving my dream to become a somewhat "decent" web developer. I hope yall enjoy browsing through my works.
