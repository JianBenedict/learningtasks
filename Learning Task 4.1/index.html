                Life, sometimes so wearying
                Is worth its weight in gold
                The experience of traveling
                Lends a wisdom that is old
                Beyond our 'living memory'
                A softly spoken prayer:
                
                "It's the journey that's important,
                Not the getting there!"
              </a>

                <a2>
                Ins and outs and ups and downs
                Life's road meanders aimlessly?
                Or so it seems, but somehow
                Leads us where we need to be,
                And being simply human
                We oft question and compare...
                
                "Is the journey so important
                Or the getting there?"
               </a2>

               <a3>
                And thus it's always been
                That question pondered down the ages
                By simple men with simple ways
                To wise and ancient sages...
                How sweet then, quietly knowing
                Reaching destination fair:
                
                "It's the journey that's important,
                Not the getting there!"
              </a3>
